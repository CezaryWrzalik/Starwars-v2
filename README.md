# Starwars-v2

## Why did i do that
Idk realy. That was my first  project in Next.js and i tried to understand how NextAuth works ðŸ˜….
Thats probably why u can create an account and all it gives is posibility to change your password ðŸ˜†

## What does it do?
Fetching data from Starwars Api.
For example u can go to people find character u want and get information about his hight or age or in which films he has played.


## Future plans
Change links in characters/id so they wont redirect into api page..

## Vercel
